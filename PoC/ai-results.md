# CompliLedger AI Service Analysis Results

## **1. Overview**

The AI service in CompliLedger connects to the **Google Gemini 2.5-flash model** for automated security and compliance analysis. This service performs comprehensive checks on:

1. **SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials)**
2. **Artifacts (software packages)**
3. **Smart Contracts**

It evaluates **risks, compliance status, and recommendations**, producing a detailed score and actionable findings.

---

## **2. Basic SBOM Analysis**

* Focuses on **direct components** (like Flask and Requests) in the SBOM.
* Output shows:
  * **High-severity risk:** Flask vulnerable to session hijacking.
  * **Medium risks:** CRLF injection in Requests, outdated dependencies.
* **Compliance Status:** Fails NIST 800-218 SSDF controls (PS.3, PS.4, etc.).
* **Recommendations:** Upgrade dependencies, implement CI/CD vulnerability scanning, enforce patch management.
* **Overall Score:** 35/100 (low, meaning high risk).
* **Findings:** Each risk mapped to specific controls with remediation suggestions.

---

## **3. Standard SBOM Analysis**

* Goes deeper than basic analysis: checks **transitive dependencies, licenses, hashes, and component provenance**.
* Key risks:
  * Missing cryptographic hashes → cannot verify integrity.
  * Incomplete dependency graph → blind spots in security.
  * Missing license info → legal/compliance risk.
* **Compliance:** Fails most controls; some partial passes.
* **Overall Score:** 22/100 → very high risk.
* Recommendations include:
  * Include hashes and licenses in SBOM.
  * Capture all transitive dependencies.
  * Implement automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## **4. Artifact Analysis**

* Focused on **a specific software package** (`test-package.tar.gz`).
* Risks identified:
  * **Critical:** No digital signature → no authenticity or tamper-proofing → high supply chain risk.
  * **High:** Undetected tampering possible.
  * **Medium:** Source code may have vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance:** Fails key NIST SSDF controls (PO.3, PS.3, PS.4, PS.6).
* **Overall Score:** 40/100.
* Recommendations:
  * Digitally sign all artifacts.
  * Integrate signature verification in deployment.
  * Conduct SAST and SCA on source code.

---

## **5. Smart Contract Analysis**

* Evaluates a smart contract (length: 1513 lines).
* Maps **10 security controls** relevant to supply chain and update integrity.
* Recommendations:
  * Implement **supply chain integrity checks** in contracts.
  * Add **data integrity checks** for on-chain data.

* Each analysis type generates:
  * **Risk Assessment:** High/Medium/Low vulnerabilities
  * **Compliance Status:** Which NIST SSDF controls passed or failed
  * **Recommendations:** Specific remediation actions
  * **Score:** Overall security/compliance score

---

## **7. Security Control Integration**

* Utilizes **1214 security controls** from NIST OSCAL repositories:
  * NIST SP800-53 Rev 5 (1193 controls)
  * NIST 800-218 SSDF (21 controls)
* Controls are organized by families:
  * SC: System and Communications Protection (162 controls)
  * AC: Access Control (147 controls)
  * SA: System and Services Acquisition (145 controls)
  * SI: System and Information Integrity (118 controls)
  * And many others

---

## **8. Implementation Technologies**

* **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
* **Integration**: Python-based backend service
* **Control Storage**: JSON format for efficient searching
* **Analysis Methods**: 
  * Semantic matching
  * Keyword and pattern recognition
  * Control family relevance scoring
* **Output Format**: Structured JSON with risk assessments, findings, and recommendations

---

## **9. Key Benefits**

* **Automated Risk Detection**: Identifies security vulnerabilities without manual review
* **Compliance Mapping**: Direct mapping to industry standards (NIST)
* **Actionable Insights**: Clear recommendations for remediation
* **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyzes SBOMs, artifacts, and smart contracts
* **Blockchain Integration**: Results can be anchored on Algorand TestNet for immutability
* **IPFS Storage**: OSCAL-compliant results stored with decentralized persistence

---

✅ **Takeaway**:

CompliLedger's AI service provides automated detection of **vulnerabilities in components, artifacts, and smart contracts** with **actionable guidance** for remediation. The scoring system indicates the **overall security posture**, with lower scores indicating higher risk.
